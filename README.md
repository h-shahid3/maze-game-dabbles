# Gameplay

The player moves using the classical WASD keys, and pressing enter to update the maze and player and monster position.

The gameplay involves attempting to pick up a powerup an use it to kill the three monsters within the maze to achieve victory. If a player touches a monster without a powerup, they will die, and otherwise, they will kill it.

The maze itself starts off hidden and is further revealed with each move the player makes towards a hidden area.
